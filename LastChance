December 20, 2024- I was generating a healthy profit margin (20%) with the NFL. With so few opportunities to make money, I calculated that I would need to bet $2000 on every game to generate a full profit. Since they play NBA games almost every day for eight months a year, I would only need to bet $100 a game to potentially generate a full income. I noticed that the formula mentioned in the NFL Repositiory doesn't work nearly as well with NBA games, so I will use this space to determine what I need to change to turn a profit.

For tonights games, the formula predicted the following scores versus the actual scores:

December 12, 2024- The only way I'll ever be able to generate a full income with the formula is by picking basketball games, so I'm going to save my coach ratings here.

January 1, 2025- Since the Phoenix Suns couldn't beat a Memphis Grizzlies team missing six of their 10 best players due to injury, I'm going to add them to the "Do Not Pick" list.

January 15, 2025- It seems like the real money is in fantasy sports. I'm hoping I can find a pattern among the 9-player winning teams on Fanduel basketball. Some of the factors that could decide what is the best team include injuries, playing back to back nights, the opposing team's defense, how competitive the game will be, and recent player performance. I think injuries, whether it's going to be a close game, and the opposing team's defense will be the most important factors, but we'll see. 

January 30, 2025- I'm hoping using every NBA team's average points per game (PPG) instead of the oddsmaker's predictions will make the formula more accurate. I went three for three on January 29th, so I added the team PPG below.

Predictions for January 30, 2025 with new formula:

Uta  100.35         113

Hou  111.05         119

Orl  104.25          90
Por  97.25          119


February 1, 2025- It seems like the original formula works best, but I need to use the average PPG for every team instead of what the oddsmaker's predict. Even with the adjustment, NBA games are way too unpredictable to give me a chance to turn a profit. 

February 12, 2025- For reasons I'll never completely understand, the day of the week makes a big difference when predicting baseball and hockey scores. For hockey, I add 0.1 goals to the underdog's score for Monday's and work my way up to 0.7 for Sunday's. I believe there's an average of around six goals a game in the NHL, and there are about 220 points scores in an NBA game. To start, I will add one point to the underdog's score for Monday's and work my way up to seven points on Sunday's.

It seems like the day of the week has more of an impact than I predicted. From now on, I will add two points to the underdog's score on Monday's and work my way up to 14 points on Sunday's.
